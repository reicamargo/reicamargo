### Hi there 👋

I'm Reinaldo and I've been working with Digital Products in the past 12 years. 

At the beginning of my professional carrier I started as a C#, Web and Swifft programmer. Later on, I migrated to a more process oriented role: so I started to work as an Agile Coach. 

Many years has passed and I found myself frustared and stucked in Agile. It seemed to me that I wasn't been chalenged anymore and I was not learning anything new. So, I recently decided to go back to my origins: my developer days.

This time I choose to focus on iOS platform, so my old friend Swift and I became friends again. =)
